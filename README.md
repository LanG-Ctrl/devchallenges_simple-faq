<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project is a simple FAQ section built as part of a challenge on devChallenges. The goal was to create a responsive, visually appealing FAQ layout with consistent styling across different devices.

### What I learned

Working on this project, I improved my skills in:
- Creating responsive layouts with Flexbox.
- Using CSS custom properties for consistent theming.
- Managing spacing and alignment for a clean layout.
- Structuring semantic HTML5 for accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This was an invaluable resource for understanding how Flexbox works, helping me create responsive layouts with ease.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This comprehensive guide on CSS Grid was instrumental in understanding grid properties and making a clean, well-aligned layout.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I used Google Fonts to choose the best typography for the project, making sure the FAQ section looked visually appealing.
- [W3Schools HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - A great reference for semantic HTML5 tags, which helped ensure the page was accessible and well-structured.
- [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/) - This site was very useful for checking CSS properties' browser compatibility to ensure my layout worked on all major browsers.
  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
